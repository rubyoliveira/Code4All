### Data Model/Server Endpoints
I am going to be linking a course page to its information within a database that will hold all the modules which hold all the topics and data for the course to be taught. I also want to use an api to use Facebook or Github to sign in and additionally I want cute dog pictures to be badges as you progress through courses and be held in your profile so I want to use a dog api.
